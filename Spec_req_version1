Team Mt. Evans is beginning our exploration into the project for Unstructured Data Analysis. 
Below are summaries of functional and nonfunctional requirements agreed upon by the team.

Dataset: We will be utilizing COVID-19 data provided by Kaggle.com. CSV files can be found in the master banch.

Environment: We will be exploring AWS services, inclusing EMR and S3. We are going to be exploring different visualization
tools, including Folium, Amazon Quicksight, and Tableau (dependent on research question chosen)

Language: We will be using Spark with Python

Roles: The team discussed individual strengths and weaknesses in this project. We also delegated first step roles for program
exploration. 
- Caleb: Amazon Quicksight exploration
- Sumner: Folium exploration
- Stephen: Agile exploration
- Stephen and Olivia: Assembly of Requirement Spec deliverable
**Team member's roles are ever-evolving and will change with the demands of the project**

In this first phase, it is the team's goal to ingest the chosen data into local machines and explore it further. We are
currently brainstorming potential research questions independently and exploring the visualization tools necessary for 
said questions. The team will reconvene next week to discuss findings and next steps in the analysis. Some questions that
have been presented as potential analyses are:

- What relationships can we draw between high population centers (i.e. New York City, Los Angeles) and rate of infection?

- If we can gather data regarding when each state implemented “Shelter in Place” or “Stay at Home” orders, 
can we demonstrate a marked decrease in confirmed cases?

- Does the data support the efficacy of one method of social distancing (relatively relaxed i.e. Sweden) vs. another (i.e. The UK, The US)?

- Can we model the time from the first confirmed case to the first 1,000 cases (could be 5,000, 10,000) across different countries?

- Time series forecasting of Covid to see trend, seasonal and residual by using ARIMA in different countries. > Time series

- How many confirmed cases in Colorado and when is everything going to slow down? > data visualization

- Comparison of case growth across Colorado counties (geographical visualization -- gradient map)

- Comparison of country with slowest growth (New Zealand) vs. fastest growth (USA)

- Linear regression analysis of Colorado growth cases vs. New York growth cases (doesn't have to be NY)

Moving forward, the team will discuss findings agree upon a research question to delve into. We will then decide upon
a visualization prgram that will suit our needs, and we will begin to develop the code to tackle the research question.
Upon further instruction from the professor, we will discuss needs for the Design Documentation.
